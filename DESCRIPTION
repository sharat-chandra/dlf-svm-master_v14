Description: Provides machine learning-based prediction of DPP4 (Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4) 
    inhibitory activity for small molecules. The package uses a pre-trained Support Vector 
    Machine model with molecular descriptors and fingerprints to classify compounds into 
    different activity levels. DPP4 is an important therapeutic target for type 2 diabetes 
    treatment. The package includes functions for molecular descriptor calculation and 
    activity prediction from SMILES chemical notation.
